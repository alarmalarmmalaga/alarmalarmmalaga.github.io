Alarm! Alarm! is a punk band from Málaga singing about all the stuff we try to ignore: aging, work, and the general disappointment of modern life. The current lineup includes Pablo Rodríguez (vocals and guitar), Alejandro Villegas (drums and backing vocals), and Mike Thrippleton (bass and backing vocals). Former members include Emilio Villegas (bass and selective silence) and José Arjona (guitar and backing vocals).
Their debut album Bloody Hell! (2020) was a loud scream into the void. The follow-up, Whatever... (2022), confirmed that things hadn’t improved. Now, in 2025, they surprise everyone (including themselves) by releasing three new EPs, the first titled '98-'99 — a nostalgic, melodic tribute to the era of baggy jeans and MSN Messenger.
Alarm! Alarm! won’t fix your problems, but they’ll shout them loud enough to make you feel better.
