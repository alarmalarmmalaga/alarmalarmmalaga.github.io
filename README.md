# Alarm! Alarm! - Official Website

## ðŸŽ¸ About Us

Alarm! Alarm! is a punk band from MÃ¡laga singing about all the stuff we try to ignore: aging, work, and the general disappointment of modern life. The current lineup includes Pablo RodrÃ­guez (vocals and guitar), Alejandro Villegas (drums and backing vocals), and Mike Thrippleton (bass and backing vocals). Former members include Emilio Villegas (bass and selective silence) and JosÃ© Arjona (guitar and backing vocals).

Their debut album Bloody Hell! (2020) was a loud scream into the void. The follow-up, Whatever... (2022), confirmed that things hadnâ€™t improved. Now, in 2025, they surprise everyone (including themselves) by releasing three new EPs, the first titled '98-'99 â€” a nostalgic, melodic tribute to the era of baggy jeans and MSN Messenger.

Alarm! Alarm! wonâ€™t fix your problems, but theyâ€™ll shout them loud enough to make you feel better.
