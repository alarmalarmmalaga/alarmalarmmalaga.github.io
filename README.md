# Alarm! Alarm! | Official Punk Rock Band from Málaga

## 🎸 About the Band
**Alarm! Alarm!** is a high-energy punk rock band based in **Málaga, Spain**. We write songs about the things most people try to ignore: the grind of the 9-to-5, the absurdities of aging, and the general disappointment of modern life. 

If you're looking for melodic riffs, raw honesty, and the sound of a mid-life crisis set to a fast tempo, you're in the right place.

## 💿 Discography & 2025 EP Series
We believe in maximum noise with strategically calibrated effort. After two full-length albums, 2025 marks our "Assault Series" with three brand-new EPs.

* **Amateur Skater (EP, 2025):** Our latest release. A fast-paced exploration of trying to stay radical while your joints tell you otherwise.
* **'98-'99 (EP, 2025):** A melodic tribute to the era of baggy jeans, MSN Messenger, and the peak of 90s punk.
* **Whatever... (LP, 2022):** A confirmation that, indeed, things haven't improved.
* **Bloody Hell! (LP, 2020):** Our debut scream into the void, recorded at Hollers Analog Studio.
